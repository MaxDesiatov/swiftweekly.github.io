It still feels strange to me that every time I start writing this introduction,
I think about the two weeks that have just flown by. It makes me appreciate
how valuable time can be, and makes it feel worth it to provide all of you with
an overview of what's been happening in the "world of Swift".

I also want to give another massive _thank you_ to [Kristaps](https://twitter.com/fassko),
whose contributions are what make it possible for me to continue writing these
issues.

I'd like to encourage you to stand still and reach out to or thank someone that
has been helping you â€” speaking from my experience, it really makes a
difference.

### Starter tasks

- [SR-12648](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-12648) [Standard Library]
`RangeReplaceableCollection`'s `filter` uses an intermediate array
- [SR-12605](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-12605) [Compiler]
`#sourceLocation` doesn't allow underscores in line numbers
- [SR-12585](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-12585) [Project Infrastructure]
Teach update-checkout to `fetch` before `checkout`

### News and community

[Mattt](https://twitter.com/mattt) announced [DocTest](https://github.com/SwiftDocOrg/DocTest),
an experimental tool for testing Swift example code in documentation. During
my brief foray in the land of Python, this is something I loved a lot about the
language. Mattt indicates Python's `doctest` indeed inspired this work, too.

Xcode 11.4.1 [was released](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode_release_notes/xcode_11_4_1_release_notes),
including a fix for a compiler crash and removed an incorrectly emitted error
for Swift packages.

### Accepted proposals

[SE-0281](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0281-main-attribute.md): *`@main`: Type-Based Program Entry Points* was [accepted with modifications](https://forums.swift.org/t/accepted-with-modifications-se-0281-main-type-based-program-entry-points/35400).

> The feedback was generally positive and the proposal has been accepted with
one minor revision: the `main()` signature will be throwing.

### Proposals in review

[SE-0282](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0282-atomics.md): *Low-Level Atomic Operations* is [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0282-low-level-atomic-operations/35382).

> This proposal adds a limited set of low-level atomic operations to the
Standard Library, including native spellings for C++-style memory orderings.
Our goal is to enable intrepid library authors to start building synchronization
constructs directly in Swift.
>
> In Swift today, application developers use dispatch queues and Foundation's
`NSLocking` protocol to synchronize access to mutable state across concurrent
threads of execution.
>
> However, for Swift to be successful as a systems programming language, it
needs to also provide low-level primitives that can be used to implement such
synchronization constructs (and many more!) directly within Swift.

[SE-0279](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0279-multiple-trailing-closures.md): *Multiple Trailing Closures* is [under a second review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0279-multiple-trailing-closures-amended/35435).

> This is the second review, with a modified proposal. The core team has
considered the feedback from the first review and believes that:
>
> - the underlying motivation for the proposal _does_ merit a change to the
language to better accommodate multiple trailing closures;
> - the concerns around the original proposed syntax warranted a rethink of the
proposed solution.
>
> The proposal authors have a revised proposal that aims to address some of
those concerns.

### Swift Forums

[Daniel Dunbar](https://twitter.com/daniel_dunbar) shared his [SwiftPM wishlist](https://forums.swift.org/t/my-swiftpm-wishlist-aka-proposal-proposals/35292):

> [..] one thing that occurred to me is that it might not be very clear to the
community what are concrete examples of things kinds of enhancement proposals
that are good candidates.
>
> Also, while I barely contribute to SwiftPM anymore, we make very heavy use of
SwiftPM in the work our team currently does, so I have a lot of opinions from
managing large & complex graphs of SwiftPM projects.
>
> With that in mind, here is my own personal "wishlist" of SwiftPM enhancements
that are also _unblocked_ from my perspective, in the sense that if someone
wanted to show up with a proposal and an implementation, the project would be
eager to work towards accepting them.

for a list of "proposal proposals".

[Alexander Ronald Altman](https://twitter.com/pthariensflame) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/declaration-like-argument-blocks/35336)
to add declaration-like argument blocks.

> There have been a fair number of proposals for making multiple closure
arguments to a function look nicer and be more readableâ€”most recently [SE-279](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0279-multiple-trailing-closures/34255).
These have all come up against ergonomic issues and lack of community consensus
because they assume something close to the trailing closure syntax is what's
needed. Iâ€™d like to propose a very different approach, inspired directly by [a
hitherto unique feature of the language Ceylon](https://ceylon-lang.org/documentation/1.3/reference/expression/named-argument-list/),
and which counterintuitively makes a complicated call site easier to read by
increasing its length and verbosity (but also its expressiveness and
formattability). I call these **Declaration-Like Argument Blocks**, and the
intuitive idea is to make a complicated call site look a lot like a class or
struct declaration.

[Dave Abrahams](https://twitter.com/DaveAbrahams) shared [an update](https://forums.swift.org/t/solving-the-mutating-slice-cow-problem/35297)
on solving the mutating slice Copy on Write problem.

> [SR-12524](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-12524) describes a problem we've
had since the earliest days of Swift. For years there has been talk of solving
it with language features, and in fact we got one of the necessary features in
coroutine accessors. I think I can now demonstrate it's the only feature we
needed, and I'll propose we incorporate this capability into the standard
library.

[Jordan Rose](https://twitter.com/UINT_MIN) shared [some thoughts](https://forums.swift.org/t/sketching-out-more-efficient-variadics/35346)
and sketched out more efficient variadics.

> 1. Variadics and array literals both default to allocating Arrays, which
usually means a heap allocation.
> 2. The compiler can already stack-promote Arrays _if_ it can prove that there
are no outstanding references to the Array instance.
> 3. But it's hard to do that through a non-inlinable function call.
> 4. We can sidestep that problem today by using `UnsafeBufferPointer`.
> 5. When move-only types come along, we're _close_ to being able to make a
safe `BorrowedBuffer` type. (Which we'll very likely want anyway, for other
purposes.)
> 6. If we then come up with a syntax to allow types other than `Array` to be
used for variadic parameters, we get safe stack-allocated variadics out of it.
(I don't much care what the syntax is at the moment.)

[Ben Cohen](https://twitter.com/AirspeedSwift) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/renaming-trailing-closure-functions-in-the-standard-library/35454)
to rename trailing closure functions in the standard library.

> A review of the standard library should be undertaken on all high-order
functions to determine whether their argument label is important, and if so,
recommend adding a second method with the argument label hoisted into the
basename. This would be source breaking, but justified under the "active harm"
exception, since the readability of methods such as `drop(while:)` is currently
severely impaired by dropping the argument label. The original method should be
deprecated over time (probably when we next introduce a new language variant).
>
> Note, not all argument labels are necessary for readability, and would have
been better left out altogether. These should be left alone rather than changed
for consistency, since the bar for source breakage is high.

[Paul Cantrell](https://twitter.com/inthehands) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/allow-key-paths-to-reference-unapplied-instance-methods/35582)
to allow key paths to reference unapplied instance methods.

> The [original key path proposal](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0161-key-paths.md)
expressly limited key paths to be able to reference only properties and
subscripts:

```swift
\Person.name                  // KeyPath<Person, String>
\Person.pets[0]               // KeyPath<Person, Pet>
```

> This proposal adds the ability for key paths to reference instance methods,
optionally specifying argument names:

```swift
\Person.sing                  // KeyPath<Person, () -> Sound>
\Person.sing(melody:lyrics:)  // KeyPath<Person, (Melody, String) -> Sound>
```

> Note that these key paths do not provide argument values; they reference
_unapplied_ methods, and the value they give is a function, not the the value
that results from calling the method.
>
> Adding this capability not only removes an inconsistency in Swift, but also
solves practical problems involving `map`/`filter` operations, proxying with
key path member lookup, and passing weak method references that do not retain
their receiver.
