### News and community

[Ted Kremenek](https://twitter.com/tkremenek) shared that Apple [is sponsoring
PLDI this year](https://twitter.com/tkremenek/status/1243235856791429122) — the
Programming Language Design and Implementation conference. As Ted said:

> Swift has drawn inspiration from many programming languages and those of us
working on Swift are proud to be part of the broader programming language
community.

[Mattt](https://twitter.com/mattt) wrote [an article](https://nshipster.com/swift-log/)
on `swift-log`, a community-driven, open-source standard for logging in Swift,
backed by Apple.

Furthermore, Mattt [announced](https://github.com/SwiftDocOrg/swift-doc)
`swift-doc`, generating documentation for Swift projects.

[Jasdev Singh](https://twitter.com/jasdev) wrote [an article](https://jasdev.me/fusion-primer)
talking about the "fusion" term he struggled to build intuition around until he
read through Combine’s documentation.

[Saleem Abdulrasool](https://twitter.com/compnerd) announced [SwiftNIO is now
running on Windows](https://forums.swift.org/t/windows-nio/35003)!

### Commits and pull requests

[Owen Voorhees](https://twitter.com/owenvoorhees) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/27776)
which implements [SE-0276](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0276-multi-pattern-catch-clauses.md): *Multi-Pattern Catch Clauses*. Awesome!

[Robert Widmann](https://twitter.com/CodaFi_) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/30723)
with a new approach for recording incremental build dependencies using the
request evaluator, paving the way for faster builds in the future. 🏎

[Suyash Srijan](https://twitter.com/suyashsrijan) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/26632)
implementing [SE-0268](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0268-didset-semantics.md): *Refine `didSet` Semantics*, as well as [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/28916) implementing [SE-280](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0280-enum-cases-as-protocol-witnesses.md): *Enum cases as protocol witnesses*.

[Stephen Canon](https://twitter.com/stephentyrone) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/30130)
implementing [SE-0277](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0277-float16.md): *`Float16`*.

### Accepted proposals

[SE-0280](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0280-enum-cases-as-protocol-witnesses.md): *Enum cases as protocol witnesses* was [accepted](https://forums.swift.org/t/accepted-se-0280-enum-cases-as-protocol-witnesses/34850).

> Almost all of the feedback we received was in favor of making this change,
and the Core Team is convinced that this closes an unnecessary semantic gap
between enums and other types.

### Proposals in review

[SE-0281](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0281-main-attribute.md): *`@main`: Type-Based Program Entry Points* is [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0281-main-type-based-program-entry-points/34948).

> A Swift language feature for designating a type as the entry point for
beginning program execution. Instead of writing top-level code, users can use
the `@main` attribute on a single type. Libraries and frameworks can then
provide custom entry-point behavior through protocols or class inheritance.

### Swift Forums

[Dave Abrahams](https://twitter.com/DaveAbrahams) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/a-better-data-pretty-printer/34914)
to introduce a better data pretty-printer.

> With this post, I hope to open a discussion of the design requirements for a
library, similar to Python's [pprint](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/pprint.html),
that could eventually be incorporated into the standard library and inform the
design of many parts of the Swift ecosystem.
>
> There are many contexts—from educational/research tools like Playgrounds and
[Colab Notebooks](https://colab.research.google.com/notebook#create=true&language=swift)
to industrial programming activities like debugging and logging, in which it's
important to be able to easily visualize/understand Swift data structures. For
consumption by actual humans, though, Swift's facilities for formatting data
leave a _lot_ to be desired.

[Jon Gilbert](https://forums.swift.org/u/vitamin) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/property-initialization-using-a-keypath-within-an-init-method/35034)
for Property initialization using a KeyPath within an `init` method.

> Given:

```swift
struct Foo {
    let bar: Int
}
```

> In an `init` method, you can do:

```swift
init() {
    self.bar = 42
}
```

> However, unfortunately, you cannot do:

```swift
init() {
    self[keyPath: \.bar] = 42
}
```

> This error is thrown: "`self` used before all stored properties are
initialized."
>
> This seems like a compiler bug, or at least, a counter-intuitive aspect of
keypaths. If a property setter works on `self` before its properties are
initialized, then a `keyPath` subscript should also work.

[Shawn Baek](https://twitter.com/yoshiboarder) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/table-style-print-for-2d-array-dictionary-and-tuples/35121)
for table style printing for two dimensional Arrays, Dictionaries, and tuples.

> The standard library `print` doesn't support table-style output. So it is
hard to check the data in the 2D array.
>
> Here is my suggestion.

```swift
print(
    table: ["Good", "Very Good", "Happy", "Cool!"], 
    header: ["Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat"]
)
```

> Output:

```
+----+---------+-----+-----+
|Wed |Thu      |Fri  |Sat  |
+----+---------+-----+-----+
|Good|Very Good|Happy|Cool!|
+----+---------+-----+-----+
```
