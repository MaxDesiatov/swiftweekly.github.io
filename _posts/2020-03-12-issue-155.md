### Podcasts

In episode 85 of Swift Unwrapped, Jesse and JP talk [about Swift on Windows and other news](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/317221).

### News and community

[Nate Cook](https://twitter.com/nnnnnnnn/) wrote [a blog post](https://swift.org/blog/argument-parser/) on Swift.org,
announcing ArgumentParser, an open-source library that makes it straightforward
— even enjoyable! — to parse command-line arguments in Swift.

Swift 5.1.5 [has been released](https://swift.org/download/).

### Commits and pull requests

[Doug Gregor](https://twitter.com/dgregor79) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/30174)
that adds `switch` statement support to function builders!

In that pull request, Doug pushed [a commit](https://github.com/apple/swift/commit/ea8d143f6425e4db7ba78df82776cc075add1e22)
after a code review from [John McCall](https://twitter.com/pathofshrines) who
noted a subtle omission in constraint generation that affected the semantics of
switch statements in function builders.

[David Smith](https://twitter.com/Catfish_Man) and [Tim K](https://github.com/tbkka) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/30329) that provides a speedup for bridging
ObjC collections containing NSStrings.

[Kuba (Brecka) Mracek](https://twitter.com/kubamracek) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/30112),
upstreaming arm64e support for Swift.

Also:

> this means we finally won’t have a billion arm64e merge conflicts every
single week

Pretty neat!

### Proposals in review

[SE-0280](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0280-enum-cases-as-protocol-witnesses.md): *Enum cases as protocol witnesses* is [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0280-enum-cases-as-protocol-witnesses/34257).

> The aim of this proposal is to lift an existing restriction, which is that
enum cases cannot participate in protocol witness matching.
>
> Currently, Swift has a very restrictive protocol witness matching model where
a protocol witness has to match _exactly_ with the requirement, with some
exceptions (see [Protocol Witness Matching Manifesto](https://forums.swift.org/t/protocol-witness-matching-mini-manifesto/32752)).

[SE-0279](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0279-multiple-trailing-closures.md): *Multiple Trailing Closures* is [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0279-multiple-trailing-closures/34255).

> Since its inception, Swift has supported _trailing closure_ syntax, which is
a bit of syntactic sugar that makes passing closures more ergonomic. Trailing
closures have always had two restrictions that limited their applicability.
First, that any call is limited to a single trailing closure, making the
feature awkward or even unusable when an API has more than one callback. This
limitation was noticed [very early on in Swift's
lifetime](https://www.natashatherobot.com/swift-trailing-closure-syntax/) as
"the" problem with trailing closure syntax. Second, that a trailing closure
argument does not provide an argument label, which can lead to call sites that
are less clear. This proposal removes both restrictions by providing an
unambiguous syntax for providing multiple, labeled trailing closures in a call,
leading to clearer and more consistent code.  

### Swift Forums

[Joe Groff](https://twittter.com/jckarter) provided [an update](https://forums.swift.org/t/update-on-se-0057/34246)
on [SE-0057](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0057-importing-objc-generics.md).

> The core team is continuing to review the status of older proposals in order
to bring their status into line with reality. SE-0057 introduced the ability
for Swift to import Objective-C lightweight generics as compile-time generic
types in Swift, with some limitations due to the type-erased nature of generics
in Objective-C. Although this proposal was accepted, and claimed to be in the
"Implemented" state, one aspect of the proposal was not implemented. The
originally accepted proposal described an informal protocol by with Objective-C
classes could optionally provide generic argument information back to Swift.
>
> However, that informal protocol was never implemented. The Core Team has
decided to withdraw this aspect of the proposal.

[Alejandro Alonso](https://github.com/Azoy) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/tuples-conform-to-equatable-comparable-and-hashable/34156)
to have tuples conform to `Equatable`, `Comparable`, and `Hashable`.

> Tuples in Swift currently lack the ability to conform to protocols. This has
led many users to stop using tuples altogether in favor of structures that they
can them conform protocols to. The shift from tuples to structures have made
tuples almost feel like a second class type in the language because of them not
being able to do simple operations that should _just_ work.

[Varun Gandhi](https://forums.swift.org/u/varun_gandhi/summary) raised [a question](https://forums.swift.org/t/abi-compatibility-hazards-and-new-language-proposals/34347)
about ABI compatibility and language proposals.

> One implication of [SE-0280](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0280-enum-cases-as-protocol-witnesses)
is that it introduces a way into the language in which one can break binary
compatibility without breaking source compatibility. More specifically, one can
make a property witness and replace that with an enum case (which also acts as
a witness) but this would break binary compatibility (the other way round
breaks source compatibility, as a client may be pattern-matching on the enum
case you're getting rid of). There are already other ways in which this happens
today (such as with [SE-0267](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0267-where-on-contextually-generic.md)),
but this proposal adds one more way this can happen.
>
> Compared to most other languages, Swift has a much better story around binary
compatibility. Part of the reason why I really like the design is that (in the
majority of cases) changes that "should" not break binary compatibility do not
break binary compatibility. To reappropriate the phrase, fast and loose
reasoning is morally correct with regard to binary compatibility -- (in the
majority of cases) source-equivalent code is ABI-equivalent.
>
> If we add more cases like this, that adds an extra wrinkle that users need to
be wary about. I suspect that a large fraction of users of this feature will
probably not be affected by this change. A small percentage of people might be
affected: should we have a backup plan for them?
